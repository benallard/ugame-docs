Kit Assembly
************

Because of logistics and regulations, µGame currently only comes as a kit
without the battery included, and with the display screen not attached. It
requires some assembly.


Battery
=======

You can use any phone battery of at least 400mAh capacity. I have found that
the Nokia BL-5B fits on the back of the device nicely, and that you can stick
it there with a two-sided tape. Then you will have to solder the battery leads.

Make sure to get the polarity (plus and minus) right, because there is no
reverse polarity protection, and you will fry the device and possibly damage
the battery in the process if you connect it in reverse.

Also make sure to move the display screen away from the soldering points, so
that you don't melt its plastic while working. Solder two short wires to the
pads on the back of the device, and to the battery terminals. Refer to this
photo.

Note that different batteries have their terminals arranged differently, and
that there is usually a third terminal with just a resistor connected to it,
for battery identification — you don't need to connect that third terminal to
anything. It's best to use a multimeter to make sure you got the connections
right.


Screen
======

Once you have the battery soldered, you can attach the screen in place. There
are two thin brown strips on the back of the display — they are the two-sided
tape. Just remove the brown paper from them, and stick them in place.

In practical testing we saw that those strips are rather weak until you let
them settle for a while. You might want to add your own two-sided tape there to
get a stronger binding. Be sure to stick the screen straight -- once the glue
settles, it's very hard to unstick it without damaging the display.
