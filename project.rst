About the Project
*****************

The µGame project aims to make it easy and fun to make arcade-style video games
in Python. It does that by developing a hardware platform, in form of a
handheld game console, and a software platform, in the form of the firmware for
that console.

The project started in 2017 with a series of ten prototypes using commonly
available and cheap parts. The final version, µGame 10, has been released and
is available both in the form of a kit, and as a repository of design files.
The software is based on Adafruit's CircuitPython firmware, with a number of
helper Python libraries included to make game development easier.

There is also a number of games and demos available, including a tutorial
contained in this documentation.
